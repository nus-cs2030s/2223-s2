# Practice PE1 Question: Expression

### Adapted from PE1 of 20/21 Semester 1

## Instructions to grab Practice PE Question:

1. Accept the practice question [here](https://classroom.github.com/a/prGo4l0C) 
2. Log into the PE nodes and run `~cs2030s/get-pe1-expression` to get the practice question.
3. There is no submission script

You should see the following in your home directory.
   
   - The files `Test1.java`, `Test2.java`, and `CS2030STest.java` for testing your solution.
   - The skeleton files for this question: `Operand.java` `InvalidOperandException.java`  `Operation.java` 
     
## Background

An expression is an entity that can be evaluated into a value.

We consider two types of expression in this question:

- An operand, which itself is a value.
- A binary operation, which is a mathematical function that takes in two expressions and produces an output value.

For instance,

- 3 is an expression that evaluates to 3.
- 3 + 2 is an expression that evaluates to 5
- (3 + 2) + 3 is also an expression that evaluates to 8

An operand is not necessarily an integer.  It can be of any type.
An expression can be evaluated to any type.

Three skeleton files are provided for you: `Operand.java`, `Operation.java`, and `InvalidOperandException.java`.   If you need extra classes or interfaces, create the necessary additional Java files yourself.

## Operand

----------

Create a class called `Operand` that encapsulates the operands of an operation.  The `Operand` class can contain references to a value of any reference type.  

You may create additional parent classes or interfaces if you think it is appropriate.

The Operand has an `eval` method that returns its value.

```
jshell> new Operand(5).eval()
$.. ==> 5
jshell> new Operand("string").eval()
$.. ==> "string"
jshell> new Operand(true).eval()
$.. ==> true
```

## InvalidOperandException

--------------------------

Create an unchecked exception named `InvalidOperandException` that behaves as follows:

```
jshell> InvalidOperandException e = new InvalidOperandException('!')
jshell> e.getMessage();
$.. ==> "ERROR: Invalid operand for operator !"
```

The constructor for `InvalidOperandException` takes in a `char` which is the corresponding symbol for the operation that is invalid.  

Recall that all unchecked exceptions are a subclass of `java.lang.RuntimeException`.  The class `RuntimeException` has the following constructor:

```
RuntimeException(String message)
```

that constructs a new runtime exception with the specified detail message `message`. The message can be retrieved by the `getMessage()` method.

You can test your code by running the `Test1.java` provided.  Make sure your code follows the CS2030S Java style.

```
$ javac Test1.java
$ java Test1
$ java -jar ~cs2030s/bin/checkstyle.jar -c ~cs2030s/bin/cs2030_checks.xml *.java
```

## Operation

------------

Create an abstract class called `Operation` with the following fields and methods:

- two private fields that correspond to two expressions (an expression is as defined at the beginning of this question).

- a class factory method `of`, which returns the appropriate subclass that implements a specific operation.  The first parameter of the `of` methods is a `char` to indicate the operation to be performed.  You need to support three operations:
  
  - if the first parameter is `*`, return an operation that performs multiplication on integers
  - if the first parameter is `+`, return an operation that performs concatenation on strings
  - if the first parameter is `^`, return an operation that performs XOR on booleans
  - if the first parameter is none of the above, return `null`

Note that the operator to perform XOR on two boolean variables is `^`.

For instance,

```
jshell> Operation o = Operation.of('*', new Operand(2), new Operand(3));
jshell> o.eval()
$.. ==> 6

jshell> Operation o = Operation.of('+', new Operand("hello"), new Operand("world"));
jshell> o.eval()
$.. ==> "helloworld"

jshell> Operation o = Operation.of('^', new Operand(true), new Operand(false));
jshell> o.eval()
$.. ==> true

jshell> Operation.of('!', new Operand(2), new Operand(3));
$.. ==> null

jshell> Operation o1 = Operation.of('*', new Operand(2), new Operand(3));
jshell> Operation o = Operation.of('*', o1, new Operand(4));
jshell> o.eval()
$.. ==> 24

jshell> Operation o2 = Operation.of('*', new Operand(2), new Operand(4));
jshell> Operation o = Operation.of('*', o1, o2);
jshell> o.eval()
$.. ==> 48
```

If the operands are not of the correct type, `eval` must throw an unchecked `InvalidOperandException` exception.  

For instance,

```
jshell> Operation o = Operation.of('*', new Operand("1"), new Operand(3));
jshell> try {
   ...>   o.eval();
   ...> } catch (InvalidOperandException e) {
   ...>   System.out.println(e.getMessage());
   ...> }
ERROR: Invalid operand for operator *

jshell> Operation o = Operation.of('+', new Operand(1), new Operand(4));
jshell> try {
   ...>   o.eval();
   ...> } catch (InvalidOperandException e) {
   ...>   System.out.println(e.getMessage());
   ...> }
ERROR: Invalid operand for operator +

jshell> Operation o = Operation.of('^', new Operand(false), new Operand(3));
jshell> try {
   ...>   o.eval();
   ...> } catch (InvalidOperandException e) {
   ...>   System.out.println(e.getMessage());
   ...> }
ERROR: Invalid operand for operator ^

jshell> Operation o1 = Operation.of('*', new Operand(1), new Operand(3));
jshell> Operation o2 = Operation.of('^', new Operand(false), new Operand(false));
jshell> Operation o = Operation.of('+', o1, o2);
jshell> try {
   ...>   o.eval();
   ...> } catch (InvalidOperandException e) {
   ...>   System.out.println(e.getMessage());
   ...> }
ERROR: Invalid operand for operator +

jshell> Operation o1 = Operation.of('*', new Operand(1), new Operand("3"));
jshell> Operation o2 = Operation.of('^', new Operand(false), new Operand(false));
jshell> Operation o = Operation.of('+', o1, o2);
jshell> try {
   ...>   o.eval();
   ...> } catch (InvalidOperandException e) {
   ...>   System.out.println(e.getMessage());
   ...> }
ERROR: Invalid operand for operator *
```

You can test your code by running the `Test2.java` provided.  Make sure your code follows the CS2030S Java style.

```
$ javac Test2.java
$ java Test2
$ java -jar ~cs2030s/bin/checkstyle.jar -c ~cs2030s/bin/cs2030_checks.xml *.java
```
